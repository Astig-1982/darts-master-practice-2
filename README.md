# Dart Master Practice II

**Dart Master Practice II** is a very simple app created for darts practicing.

## Note:
This app is creted in order to test my understanding of React and Redux.

## How it works:
The app calculates the average of succesful darts that reach the target out of 10 darts thrown. The user will choose a target from the darts board he/she wants to practice and can input in the app how many darts have reached the target. A set consists in 10 throws and a game consists in 10 sets. At the end, the user will have displayed the average of how many of those darts have reached the target.

## User stories:
* As a user I would like an app where I can input the number of succesful darts that reached the target.
* As a user I would like to have an average of how many darts out have reached the target after each game.
* As a user I would like to be able to choose which target I would like to practice at.
* As a user I would like to keep track of all my games and the results.
* As a user I would like in result of each game to be reflected all the useful info about that game, incl the target used for practice.
* As a user I would liket to be able to set up a goal in the game, and after the completetion of each game to be able to see how much I gap is between my results and the set goal.
